# BLDCM Electronics
These KiCad projects were made with KiCad 9.0, make sure to use the same version or a newer one.

The schematic PDFs are available in `BLDCM-Power/BLDCM-Power.pdf` and `BLDCM-MCU/BLDCM-MCU.pdf`. The Gerber files and interactive BOM can be found in the release section of the repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project depends on the [BrenoCQ KiCad library](https://github.com/brenocq/brenocq-kicad-library), included as a Git submodule. To ensure all symbols, footprints, and 3D models are available, you must initialize the submodules:
>
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```
